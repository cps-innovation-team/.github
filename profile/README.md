# Welcome

The **CPS Innovation Team** is a pilot, application-based program dedicated to harnessing creativity and collaboration to engineer products and services that enrich the College Preparatory School community. Here we'll open source appropriate software dependencies, repositories, and packages related to **the Campus app, Common Classroom website, and other ecosystem projects.**

Please contact iteam@thecollegepreparatoryschool.org for questions or support.
